Problem Statement
=====================================================

Write a program in C or C++ for computing accurately the factorial of any given non-negative number.  You need to likely use 
linked lists concepts to perform this computation. 

Find attached Sample input output files 

First line of the input file mentions T that denotes number of numbers for which factorial to be computed. Then follows T 
non-negative numbers N1 .... NT
T would be less than 500. Output file contains atleast T lines each corresponding to the factorial value for T given numbers. 
There may or may not be last line as blank line.
